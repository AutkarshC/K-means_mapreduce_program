Please use mrjob to create a K-means (e.g., K=3) mapreduce class. You just need to implement the first iteration of Kmeans algorithm.

# You will need two input files:

Points with coordinates (x and y). You could write a program to generate these points, e.g., 100 points
Coordinates for the initial centroids of the three clusters (K, x and y)

# Output:

Coordinates for the new centroids after the iteration
